# Description:
In this project, you'll learn how to read the internal temperature sensor of the ESP32 using Micropython and Thonny IDE.

# Instructions:

Ensure you have set up Thonny IDE and installed Micropython on your ESP32 board.
Connect your ESP32 board to your computer using a USB cable.
Open the temperature.py file in Thonny IDE.
Click the "Run" button (green triangle) to upload the code to the ESP32.
The program will continuously read the internal temperature sensor and display the temperature in degrees Celsius every 2 seconds.
